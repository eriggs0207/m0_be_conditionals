# Self Evaluation

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the comparison operators?

I feel fairly confident.  I did not have any issues understanding it, just some syntax errors that slowed me down

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the logical operators?

I feel very confident in using and understanding logical operators

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the if statements?

I feel fairly confident.  I am a little confused about when to use else

1. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate?

This one took me a while. Maybe 2-3 hours total. So it was almost 3 times my original time estimate.  I think a lot of it was completing multiple files in a cloned repo for the first time. Also I had some syntax errors that stumped me so I had to walk away and shift gears a few times, but got back on track once they were corrected.

1. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?

I need to adjust it for more time for these exercises moving forward.  

1. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?

I don't have any specific questions based on this lesson.  Almost all of my struggles have been simple mistakes today.  Moving forward I need to be a little more careful entering syntax, etc.
